This is the copy of GetAFix tool by Gennaro in CAV10 paper

Please launch the tool (translation from boolean program to MUCKE program) with this commands:

./a.out BOOLEAN_PROGRAM 4 SLIC_ERROR > ANYFILENAME.mu
For examples:
    ./a.out examples/001/satabs.1.bp 4 SLIC_ERROR > some.mu

If there is error here, it is likely because of syntax violations.
