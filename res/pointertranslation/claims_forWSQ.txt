1. Array of structure is badly handled in CBMC
    a. Original WSQ (with obj)
    b. Original with int replacing obj

2. Pushing out things from structure help CBMC
    a. Create a version with the global queue in global scope
    b. From that version, starting pushing things out

3. Malloc is worse than static allocation
    -- It is hard to try in this example

4. Reducing number of bits help CBMC
    -- ALL the four versions above with bit reducing
5. Memory model is not good as normal memory model of CBMC for general type
    -- version mentioned in 2.a.
    -- Manual translation of memory model for version mentioned in 2.a.
6. When reducing number of bits, memory model works better than normal CBMC model
    -- Two versions above with reducing number of bits.
