All experiments should be carried using cbmc-5.3 and using two options
 --arrays-uf-never            never turn arrays into uninterpreted functions
 --arrays-uf-always           always turn arrays into uninterpreted functions

1. Original (with size of malloc known)
    - no array option
3906293 variables, 16003773 clauses
SAT checker: negated claim is SATISFIABLE, i.e., does not hold
Runtime decision procedure: 8597.02s
real    145m9.500s
user    144m59.091s
sys 0m0.793s
2. Original with pointer malloc assigned to static array
    - no array option
2189235 variables, 9046328 clauses
SAT checker: negated claim is SATISFIABLE, i.e., does not hold
Runtime decision procedure: 2683.33s
real    46m26.923s
user    46m23.047s
sys 0m0.348s
    --arrays-uf-never
2189235 variables, 9046328 clauses
SAT checker: negated claim is SATISFIABLE, i.e., does not hold
Runtime decision procedure: 2449.54s
real    42m30.735s
user    42m27.112s
sys 0m0.288s
    --arrays-uf-always
flatten_byte_update can only do arrays of scalars right now

3. Original with static array
1433801 variables, 5811697 clauses
SAT checker: negated claim is SATISFIABLE, i.e., does not hold
Runtime decision procedure: 11098.4s
real    186m42.357s
user    186m31.036s
sys 0m0.762s

3. Mem_ver6 (all variables are indexed)





<!-- 4. Mem_ver5 (only pointer variables (with malloc) are indexed)
    a. With all guessed variable
    b. With one guessed variable
    c. Without guessed
 -->
